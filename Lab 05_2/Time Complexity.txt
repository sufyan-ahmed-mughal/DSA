Linked List vs Array Performance for Insertion and Deletion

 1. Linked List
 Insertion:
 At the beginning: O(1)  Directly modify the head pointer to insert a new node.
 At the end: O(n)  Traverse the entire list to find the last node and insert the new node.
 At a given position: O(n)  Traverse to the desired position and insert the node.

 Deletion:
 At the beginning: O(1)  Simply modify the head pointer to remove the first node.
 At the end: O(n)  Traverse to the second last node and modify its next pointer to delete the last node.
 At a given position: O(n)  Traverse to the node before the one to be deleted and modify the pointers accordingly.

 2. Array
 Insertion:
 At the beginning: O(n)  Shift all elements one position to the right to make space for the new element.
 At the end: O(1)  Insert the element at the end of the array.
 At a given position: O(n)  Shift all elements after the insertion point to the right.

 Deletion:
 At the beginning: O(n)  Shift all elements one position to the left to fill the gap.
 At the end: O(1)  Simply remove the element at the end.
 At a given position: O(n)  Shift all elements after the deletion point to the left to fill the gap.

 Summary:
 Linked lists are generally more efficient for insertion and deletion at the beginning or middle of the list because no shifting is required.
 Arrays have an advantage in random access (O(1)) compared to linked lists (O(n)).
 Arrays are more efficient for appending at the end (O(1)) compared to linked lists (O(n)).
